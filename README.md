# Githubpy
A short collection of scripts I've used to make adding and removing users from repositories a little easier when all repos are tied to a single account instead of an actual
github organization.

### Getting Started
Make sure to install Py-Github, and then make a file called admin_codes.py and store the Github Account's username & password in that file.
Then python [script_name.py] and wonder why your company doesn't just have a github org account. 

### Libraries Used
